# Overview

This contains all the data, scripts, and figures for module 8's assignment. First you should run the processing script, then EDA (exploratory data analysis, in the analysis folder), then the analysis script.

# Pre-requisites

This is a template for a data analysis project using R, Rmarkdown (and variants, e.g. bookdown), Github and a reference manager that can handle bibtex. It is also assumed that you have a word processor installed (e.g. MS Word or [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/)). You need that software stack to make use of this template.

# Structure

* All data goes into the subfolders inside the `data` folder.
* All code goes into the `code` folder or subfolders.
* All results (figures, tables, computed values) go into `results` folder or subfolders.
* All products (manuscripts, supplement, presentation slides, web apps, etc.) go into `products` subfolders.
* See the various `readme.md` files in those folders for some more information.
